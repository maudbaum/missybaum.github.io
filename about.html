			<h2>About Our Project</h2>
			<p>Libraries play a very important role on a University campus, as they are excellent academic resources and spaces to focus. At a University, inclusion of students with disabilities relies on accessbility of it's most important resources, like Libraries. <br><br>For this reason, we decided to study and analyze the accessibility of the major libraries on the University of Maryland campus. <br><br>We assessed the accessibility of each library based on <a href="https://www.humancentereddesign.org/inclusive-design/principles" target="_blank"><strong>inclusive design principles</strong></a>, rather than just ADA compliance standards that are legally required. Our process involved researching accessiblity information that was available for each library, and then visiting each building and taking note of both accessibility barriers and things that enhanced accessibility. <br><br>As a result, we found that although McKeldin Library has too many physical barriers to be considered an inclusive design, they had the most accommodating services and helpful resources for students with disabilities. For the future, we think access to information on the accessibility of the built environment. If Universities would include building accessibility information on their websites, they would begin to foster a more inclusive campus.</p>
